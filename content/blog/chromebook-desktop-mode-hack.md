So, your ChromeOS tablet won't stay in desktop mode. Luckily, I found a (slightly janky) fix for when it is in a solitary position.
## THE FIX
1. Find an old wireless (or wired) mouse you no-longer use and are okay with hacking apart. 
2. Open the case (or just cover the light externally)
3. Once opened, find the light/laser and cut it off (mine was already broken :D)
4. Close the mouse back up (or don't)
5. Hide/place it somewhere nearby.
Et Voil√†!
Your Chromebook is in Desktop mode
